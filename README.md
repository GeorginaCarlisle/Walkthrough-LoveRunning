## Credits

Credit for the vast majority of both the code and content of this project is given to [Code Institue](https://codeinstitute.net). Instruction was provided in the form of videos which I then implemented using the tools listed above.

There were however a number of challenges presented during the walkthrough where I was tasked with discovering how to code or style an element. In these instances the credit goes to myself unless otherwise stated in the challenge section above.

This README was completed independently with the following credits:

- CI logo by Code Institute.
- https://www.markdownguide.org was highly useful in learning basic markdown syntaxs.
